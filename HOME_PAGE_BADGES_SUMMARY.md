# Home Page Team Badges Implementation âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Team Badge Display on Home Page**
- Team badges now appear prominently in the Featured Teams section
- Each team card shows the actual team badge/logo from `images/teams/` folder
- Badges are styled with team-specific border colors for visual distinction

### 2. **Updated JavaScript API (api.js)**
- Fixed `getSampleTeams()` function to include correct badge paths:
  - KCCA FC: `images/teams/kccafc-badge.jpg`
  - Vipers SC: `images/teams/vipers-badge.png` 
  - SC Villa: `images/teams/scvilla-badge.png`
  - Express FC: `images/teams/express-badge.png`
  - URA FC: `images/teams/ura-badge.png`
  - UPDF FC: `images/teams/updf-badge.png`
- Primary data still loads from `data/teams.json` which has correct badge paths

### 3. **Enhanced Team Card Design (app.js)**
- Redesigned `createTeamCard()` function with improved layout:
  - Team badge prominently displayed in header
  - Better organized team information
  - Stadium, founding year, and league info with icons
  - "View Details â†’" call-to-action button
  - Fallback placeholder for missing badges

### 4. **Comprehensive Styling (index.css)**
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid that adapts to screen size
- **Team Cards**: Professional card design with hover effects
- **Badge Styling**: 60px badges with team-specific border colors:
  - KCCA FC: Gold border (#FFD700)
  - Vipers SC: Green border (#10b981) 
  - SC Villa: Purple border (#8b5cf6)
  - Express FC: Red border (#dc2626)
  - URA FC: Orange border (#f59e0b)
  - UPDF FC: Dark green border (#047857)
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile

2. **Fallback System**: If JSON fails, JavaScript uses sample data with badge paths
3. **Badge Display**: Each team card shows the badge prominently with team colors
4. **Error Handling**: If badge image fails, shows attractive placeholder icon
5. **Responsive**: Cards adapt beautifully to any screen size
